a deployed version can be found [here](https://gdgcf.vercel.app)

### quick start

step 1: make sure you have node installed

step 2: install dependencies, i recommend bun or pnpm as a pkg manager, but you can use any.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vimfn/gdgc_task_round_frontend --depth=1
cd gdgc_task_round_frontend

npm i # or bun i
npm run dev -- --open

# to build
npm run build
```

ps, maybe i could have given animations a try, this is the bare minimum and im not a frontend guy.
